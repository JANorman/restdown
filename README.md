restdown -- Pretty REST API docs authored in Markdown

Usage:
    restdown foo.restdown

Write a Markdown file that describes your REST API -- with some light
convention structure to your doc file. Run it through `restdown` and out
pops some nice HTML for your API. Choose one of the included brands and
sex it up a bit.


More details later. I'm still working on this.
